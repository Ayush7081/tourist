         <p><h2><b>1. The Taj Mahal, Agra</b></h2>
      <hr><h3>There are few sights in the world as iconic as the Taj Mahal, which is a must-see
         on most India itineraries, particularly for travelers on the famous Golden Triangle
          circuit, linking Delhi, Agra, and Jaipur. A testament to the power of an emperor’s 
          love, this astonishingly beautiful mausoleum was named after Mumtaz Mahal, who
           was the favorite wife of Shah Jahan.
        
        Construction began upon her death in 1631, and it took 20,000 of the most 
        skilled craftsmen in the Mughal empire 17 years to complete. The queen 
        consort was interred inside in a private chamber at the heart of the monument
         and Shah Jahan was later buried alongside his wife when he died in 1666. Incorporating 
         many elements of Islamic design including an onion-shaped dome, arches, towering
          minarets and filigree marble screens, the Taj shows perfect bilateral symmetry along an axis running 
        through the center of the main dome and the surrounding gardens.</h3></hr></p>

         <p><h2>2. The Red Fort, New Delhi</h2>
      <h3><hr> New Delhi’s colossal, crescent-shaped Red Fort, named after the stunning red sandstone that was used 
        in its construction, was built by Shah Jahan in 1648. Also called Lal Qalʿah, it was home to emperors
         of the formidable Mughal dynasty for almost 200 years, until 1857 when the British took over. 
         It covers a vast area of 254.67 acres ringed by one and a half miles of defensive walls, 
         enclosing a complex of palaces and entertainment halls, projecting balconies, baths and indoor
          canals, and geometrical gardens, as well as an ornate mosque.
        
        The two most famous structures of the fort complex are the Hall of Public Audience and the Hall 
        of Private Audience. The former boasting 60 red sandstone pillars supporting a flat roof, and the
         latter, which is smaller, notable for its pavilion of white marble. Turrets and bastions vary in 
         height from 59 ft on the river side to 108 feet on the city side.
        
        It took ten years to construct and is rumoured to have had the decapitated bodies of prisoners
         built into the foundations for good luck. Be sure not to miss its two largest gates: the impressive
          Lahore Gate, the fort’s main entrance, and the elaborately decorated Delhi Gate, which was once 
          
          used by the emperor for ceremonial processions. A sound and light show is held in the evenings, 
          featuring important events in the fort’s history.</h3></hr></p>

        <p><h2>3. The Gateway of India, Mumbai</h2>
           <hr> <h3> Standing an impressive 85 feet tall and located on the waterfront at Mumbai Harbour on the 
            tip of Apollo Bunder, overlooking the Arabian Sea, the iconic Gateway of India is a bold 
            yellow basalt arch of colonial triumph and a must-see when in Mumbai. Incorporating Islamic
             styles of 16th-century Gujarat, it was built to commemorate the arrival of King George V 
             and his wife Queen Mary in 1911 and was opened with much pomp and ceremony in 1924. It
              was, for a while, the tallest structure in the city.
            
            The Gateway of India was also the setting of a far less triumphant procession of British 
            soldiers in 1948 when India obtained its independence. Notable for its stunning 
            Indo-Saracenic design, a style of architecture that was introduced by the British during
             their rule in India, it combines diverse elements of the Hindu and Muslim architecture 
             with Gothic cusped arches, domes, spires, tracery, minarets and stained glass, in a uniquely playful style.
            
            This huge archway provides a spectacular backdrop that is as popular among locals as it is tourists.
             The first structure to welcome visitors entering the city by sea, it is popularly called the
              ‘Taj Mahal of Mumbai’ and is one of the top tourist attractions in India.</h3></hr><p>

        <p><h2>4. Agra Fort</h2>
          <hr>  <h3>  With the Taj Mahal located so close by, it is easy to forget that Agra has one of the finest Mughal
             forts in India. Built as a military structure in 1565 by Emperor Akbar with later additions by 
             Shah Jahan, Agra’s Red Fort is an interesting mix of both Hindu and Muslim influences. The fort 
             is entered through Amar Singh Gate with its low outer wall and dogleg design built to confuse
              attackers, and you can expect to be truly amazed as you walk through courtyard after courtyard 
              of this palatial red-sandstone and marble fortress.
            
            Once inside, you’ll see two large, interlinked sandstone buildings, Akbari Mahal and Jahangiri 
            Mahal, the largest private residence in the complex. Other highlights include the Khas Mahal 
            (Private Palace), with its splendid copper roof, and the Anguri Bagh (Grape Garden), a jigsaw-
            patterned Mughal garden with numerous wonderful fountains and water channels as well as 
            screens that once offered a private area for the emperor and his entourage. Also of note is the 
            octagonal Musamman Burj tower, which later served as Shah Jahan’s prison until his death.</h3></p></hr>

        <hr><p><h2></p>5. Manikarnika Ghat, Varanasi</h2>
         <h3>Manikarnika, the main and oldest riverfront burning ghat in Varanasi, is the most auspicious place for a 
        Hindu to be cremated. Mentioned in many ancient scriptures and religious texts, it is said to be the place
         where Devi Sati set herself on fire and also the birthplace of the fearless queen of Jhansi, Rani Lakshmibai.
            Temples of many Hindu deities surround the ghat’s periphery while the holy waters of the Ganges flow peacefully alongside.
    
         A holy well, believed to have been dug by Lord Shiva to recover the fallen earring of Goddess Sati, is 
         resent at the top of the stairs. Dead bodies are handled by outcasts known as doms and are carried through 
          the alleyways of the old town to the holy Ganges on bamboo stretchers, swathed in cloth. The corpse is
          doused in the Ganges prior to cremation.
    
         Huge piles of firewood are stacked along the top of the ghat; every log is carefully weighed on giant scales 
            so that the price of cremation can be calculated. Each type of wood has its own price, sandalwood being the most 
          expensive. There is an art to using just enough wood to completely incinerate a corpse.</h3></p></hr>
